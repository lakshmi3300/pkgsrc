Subversion 1.6 and 1.7 have different client side style, that is,
Subversion 1.7 has only one .svn directory in top of working copy,
and contents of .svn is sqlite3 based.
Subversion 1.6 has .svn directory in each directories in working copy.
Convertion to 1.7 style from 1.6 is done by svn upgrade, and this
upgrade is irreversible.

If you will continue to use old style working copy, please keep to
use subversion16 package.

This package tracks 1.6.x release branch.
