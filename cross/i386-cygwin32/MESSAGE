This package DOES NOT install headers or runtime link libraries;
only the compilers are installed.

In order to have a complete development setup, you need to install
includes and libraries in ${CROSSBASE}/i386-cygwin32/include and
${CROSSBASE}/i386-cygwin32/lib respectively, or symlink these paths to
the appropriate places.
