This package supplies the shared library files needed to run dynamically
linked executables compiled under NetBSD 6.0 on a later NetBSD.
The shared libraries for 'native' X11 are in a separate package.

Since "later NetBSD" means -current, this package is going to usually be
out of date, and thus incomplete.
Don't run postinstall fix obsolete too often :)
