This is the KDE Meta Data library (not to confuse with KFileMetaData).
It consists of the following parts:
* The main resource handling centered around Nepomuk2::Resource
* The handling of ontologies via classes in the Nepomuk2::Types namespace
* The desktop Nepomuk2::Query API
* \ref nepomuk_facets
* Several utility methods and classes
