To use "${PKGNAME}" as the system's mail transport agent you have
to install "${PREFIX}/share/examples/sendmail/mailer.conf" as global
mailwrapper configuration file.  The command below will do that for you:

ln -fs ${PREFIX}/share/examples/sendmail/mailer.conf /etc/mailer.conf

You should also add a line to /etc/mtree/special.local so you won't
get a complaint in the daily insecurity e-mail like this:

./etc/mailer.conf			type=link mode=0444


If you are changing the database format used by sendmail you must run
"newaliases" and "makemap" in order to re-create the databases.

You may also need to install (and/or customize) the configuration files
for Sendmail before it will be operational.  "cd" to the directory

    ${PREFIX}/share/sendmail/cf

and read the file README for instructions on creating and installing
configuration files.


NOTE: If your system doesn't have mailwrapper and/or it won't
install on your system, then you will need to move aside system
supplied binaries and replace them with symlinks to the binaries
supplied with sendmail.  The most important of these is the sendmail
binary itself.  This is typically located at /usr/sbin/sendmail or
/usr/lib/sendmail.  These will need to be moved aside, and you will
need to create a symlink from /usr/sbin/sendmail to
${PREFIX}/libexec/sendmail/sendmail.  This is required because most
third party apps (or, even system supplied apps) will look for
sendmail at one of the above locations.  There are a variety of
other apps such as:  editmap, hoststat, mailq, mailstats, makemap,
newaliases, praliases, purgestat, and vacation.  You can deal with
these either by having ${PREFIX}/bin and ${PREFIX}/sbin at the
beginning of your PATH, or creating symlinks.  hoststat, mailq,
mailstats, newaliases, and purgestat are just links to sendmail.
